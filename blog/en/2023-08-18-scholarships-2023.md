### Apply for the assistance scholarships for LatinR 2023!

<br>
Thanks to the support of our sponsors, this year we will be able to offer assistance scholarships that include:

- the entrance to the conference for the days 19 and 20 of October
- Registration for the tutorials on Wednesday the 18th (in two half-days or in the full-day tutorial)

In addition, depending on the case, we will provide an economic contribution of between 100 and 300 dollars for transportation and/or accommodation for people who come from outside Montevideo. We know that in many cases this amount is not enough to cover the entire trip, but it can help cushion the expense.

The application will be open until Sunday, August 27 at 23:59 (UTC - 4:00) and can be done through **[this form](https://forms.gle/eCvW3wG3fK1z7g1KA)**. The results will be published in early September.

Scholarships will be assigned considering criteria of need, diversity and possibility of impact.

The people benefiting from the economic contribution must submit travel vouchers (such as tickets, accommodation, etc.) in order to manage the reimbursement, which will be made after the conference.
